# Tutorial System Implementation

## Overview
A comprehensive on-screen tutorial system has been added to the Exchron Dashboard to guide first-time users through the application's features and functionality.

## Features

### üéØ Automatic First-Time User Detection
- Tutorial automatically appears for new users who haven't completed it before
- Uses localStorage to track completion status
- Only shows on initial app load, not on every page navigation

### üìö Five-Step Tutorial Flow
1. **Welcome & Introduction**: Explains Playground vs Classroom modes, links to learning resources, and important notices
2. **Playground Mode Workflow**: Detailed walkthrough of the 4-tab workflow for using pre-built models
3. **Classroom Mode Workflow**: Step-by-step guide to building and training custom ML models
4. **Understanding the Data**: Explains the astronomical data types and sources used in the platform
5. **Dashboard Navigation**: Guided tour of main UI components and navigation patterns

### üé® Visual Design
- Follows existing design system (Card components, CSS variables)
- Smooth animations with spring-like transitions
- Blurred dashboard background instead of black overlay
- Semi-transparent white card with backdrop blur
- Progress indicators and step counters
- Responsive design optimized for window fitting
- Custom scrollbars for better aesthetics

### ‚å®Ô∏è Accessibility Features
- Full keyboard navigation support
- Arrow keys for navigation (Left/Right)
- Enter key to proceed
- Escape key to skip/close
- Screen reader friendly content
- Focus management

### üîó External Links Integration
- Links to `learn.exchronai.earth` for exoplanet education
- Links to `docs.exchronai.earth` for detailed documentation
- Proper external link handling with security attributes

## User Experience

### First Visit
- Tutorial automatically appears after app initialization
- Users can skip immediately from the first screen
- Clear progress indicators show tutorial length

### Manual Access
- "Show Tutorial" button added to sidebar for replay functionality
- Tutorial resets to step 1 when manually opened

### Important Notices
- Prominent warning about JavaScript requirement for Classroom mode
- Educational resource promotion for users new to exoplanets
- Clear explanation of on-device machine learning capabilities

## Technical Implementation

### Components
- `Tutorial.tsx`: Main tutorial component with step management
- Integrated into `DashboardLayout.tsx` for global access
- Uses existing UI components (`Card`, `CardTitle`, `CardContent`)

### State Management
- Local state for current step and open/closed status
- localStorage for completion tracking
- Session storage for initial load detection

### Styling
- CSS animations for smooth transitions
- Consistent with existing design tokens
- Backdrop blur effect for focus
- Custom CSS classes in `globals.css`

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- `‚Üí` or `Enter`: Next step
- `‚Üê`: Previous step  
- `Escape`: Skip/close tutorial

## Content Structure

### Step 1: Welcome & Modes
- Introduction to Exchron Dashboard
- Playground mode explanation (pre-built models)
- Classroom mode explanation (custom model building)
- Link to exoplanet learning platform
- JavaScript requirement notice

### Step 2: Playground Mode Workflow
- Overview tab: Model architecture and performance metrics
- Data Input tab: Manual input and CSV upload capabilities
- Results tab: Predictions, confidence scores, and visualizations
- Enhance tab: Parameter tuning and model comparison
- Quick start recommendations

### Step 3: Classroom Mode Workflow
- Data Input & Preparation: Dataset upload and preprocessing
- Model Selection: Algorithm choice and hyperparameter configuration
- Train & Validate: Real-time training with progress monitoring
- Test & Export: Performance evaluation and model export
- Browser-based training benefits

### Step 4: Understanding the Data
- Stellar properties (temperature, luminosity, mass, etc.)
- Planetary signals (transit depth, orbital period, etc.)
- Light curve analysis and time-series data
- Classification categories and confidence scoring
- Data sources from NASA missions (Kepler, TESS, K2)

### Step 5: Dashboard Components
- Mode selector functionality and persistence
- Tab navigation optimized for each workflow
- Progress indicator for tracking workflow completion
- Help and documentation access points
- Pro tips and external resource links

## Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers with ES6+ support
- localStorage and sessionStorage support required
- CSS Grid and Flexbox support
- Works with JavaScript enabled (required for full app functionality)

## Future Enhancements
- Could add tooltips or highlights on actual UI elements
- Additional steps for mode-specific tutorials
- Video embeds or interactive demos
- Analytics tracking for tutorial completion rates
- Multi-language support
